# @description Run a script inside WSL, starting from a Windows working directory.
#              wsl.exe --cd takes the Windows path as-is, so no path conversion is needed.
#              Only SKIP_INTEGRATION_TESTS crosses the boundary: PROJECT_ROOT and friends
#              hold Windows paths, so the WSL side re-derives them instead.
#              wsl.exe is called by plain name (not via `command`) so that tests can
#              replace it with a shell function; its stderr is passed through untouched
# @arg $1 string Windows working directory handed to `wsl.exe --cd`
# @arg $2 string Script path to run, relative to that working directory
# @arg $@ Arguments forwarded to the script
# @exitcode Exit code of wsl.exe

# @description List the given commands that cannot be called inside WSL.
#              wsl.exe is started once for the whole list: starting it per command
#              would dominate the runtime. The probe asks `command -v` inside WSL and
#              echoes back only the names it could not resolve, keeping the argument
#              order. wsl.exe writes no CR to stdout, so no CR stripping is needed.
#              wsl.exe is called by plain name (not via `command`) so that tests can
#              replace it with a shell function
# @arg $@ Command names to look for inside WSL
# @stdout One missing command name per line; nothing when all of them are callable
# @exitcode 0 always
